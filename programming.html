                    <li> Project teams test each build as it becomes available. This type of software testing relies on test automation that is integrated with the deployment process.<br/> It enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process â€“ improving design and reducing risks.</li><br/>
                    <li> Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test. Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents,<br/> models, test scripts and test results. Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort.</li><br/>
                    <li>Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed,<br/> enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. They can reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment</li><br/>
                    <li> Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality.<br/> Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.</li><br/>
                    <li>Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results. Advanced tools integrate project metrics and present results in a dashboard.<br/> Teams quickly see the overall health of a project and can monitor relationships between test, development and other project elements.</li>
