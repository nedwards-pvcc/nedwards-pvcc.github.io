  <h1>What is impeachment?</h1>
  <p>
    If a federal officer commits a crime the House of Representatives may formally charge that official. If the official is convicted in a Senate impeachment trial, they are removed from office.
Impeachment can be broken into 2 branches the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Each has their own steps they need to go through.
 </p>
 <h2>Roles</h2>
 <p>
  The house has sole power of impeachment, while the senate has the sole power to try all impeachments. In short the house starts the impeachment, the senate does the trial.
 </p>
 <h1>
  House 
  </h1>
  <ol>
<li>Introduction and referral- Any member of the house may introduce charges by declaration under their own initiative, presenting a listing under oath, or introducing a resolution to be referred by a committee. Impeachments are initially referred to the House Rules Committee, which then go to the Judiciary Committee.</li>
<li>Investigation- An investigation takes place and is typically conducted by the Judiciary Committee</li>
<li>Committee Report- Once the Investigation is complete the Judiciary Committee will determine whether there are grounds for impeachment, If the majority conclude this to be the case, a resolution impeaching the individual and the allegations will be reported to The House of Representatives.</li>
<li>Debate- The House will debate the resolution, If the House majority adopt any articles of impeachment, The individual is considered impeached, and the house managers will present the charges to the U.S. Senate.</li>
</ol>
<h1>
  Senate
</h1>
<p>
  <ol>
<li>Plea-Upon receiving the resolution  the Senate will notify the House manager that they will hear the charges. The House managers will appear before the bar of the Senate to impeach the individual. The Senate will then issue a summons of the accused individual, Should the defendant not appear the plea of the individual is presumed not guilty. The defendant may argue that they are not a civil officer subject to impeachment, or the charges listed are not sufficient grounds for impeachment. They may also choose to answer the articles brought against them. The House can then file a response if any is given. </li>
<li>Trial- After the conclusion of the plea, the Senate will set a trial date. House managers will then provide information regarding witnesses to the Senate. During the trial the Senate may receive evidence and take testimony or may appoint a committee of Senators to serve this purpose. The Senate may also order that the trial be before the full Senate. At the beginning of the trial House mangers present opening arguments. During the trial evidence is presented and witnesses may be direct examined and cross-examined. The presiding officer may rule on any question of evidence presented but the officer can also refer that question to a vote of the Senate and any senator can request a vote on a particular question.  Closing arguments will be presented by each side. </li>
<li>Judgment-when the trial is concluded, the Senate will meet in a closed session to deliberate. Voting to convict must be done in open session and votes are tallied separately on each article. To convict on an article of Impeachment a two-thirds vote of senators present is required. If the officer will pronounce the judgement of the conviction and removal. The Senate may vote on whether the impeached official shall be disqualified from holding office in the future. If the Senate considers such a motion, only majority is required. </li>
